		  <p class="l"><strong>The 2017 Plan Referendum</strong></p>
		  <p class="l"><strong>Finalization Date and Time</strong><br>
		    February 3, 2017 6:28 PM CST - 8/14 In</p>
		  <p class="l"><strong>Directing the Future</strong><br>
		    Integrate Nosiphus and keep the distant members involved - 75%<br>
		    Isolate Nosiphus locally and remove ties to distant members - 25%</p>
		  <p class="l"><strong>Communications Unity</strong><br>Skype - 0<br>Razer Comms - 6<br>Discord - 3<br>Steam - 1</p>
		  <p class="l"><strong>Suspended Member System</strong><br>
		    Keep the suspension system - 87.5%<br>
		    End the suspension system and remove inactive members - 12.5%</p>
		  <p class="l"><strong>Video Production Alterations</strong><br>
		    Keep videos voice-only, as they are now - 62.5%<br>
		    Add Webcam recordings to YouTube videos in the corner - 37.5%</p>
		  <p class="l"><strong>Monetary Asset Proceedings</strong><br>
		    Split profits for individual contributions - 75%<br>
		    Split all profits 100% equally - 25%</p>
		  <p class="l"><strong>Final Decisions</strong></p>
		  <p class="l"><strong>Question 1</strong> - We attempted to keep the distant members involved, but it was becoming unfeasible to do so, and they left on February 5.</p>
		  <p class="l"><strong>Question 2</strong> - Razer Comms remained fully entrenched until Razer announced its closure. We fully moved to Discord on June 1.</p>
		  <p class="l"><strong>Question 3</strong> - The suspension system remained in effect, but is currently not in use.</p>
		  <p class="l"><strong>Question 4</strong> - Keeping videos voice-only won, and they have remained that way.</p>
		  <p class="l"><strong>Question 5</strong> - This is more a plan for the future of Nosiphus, which will be developed as time goes on.</p>
