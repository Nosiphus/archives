			<p>It is easy to state the obvious: 2018 was hands-down the single worst year of both my lifetime and in the timeline of Nosiphus. When that terrible year was finally brought to an end, it brought a new and highly-anticipated year. Little did I know just how well the expectations would pay off.</p>
			<p>In mid-January 2019, Minecraft, a game we all considered dying, was hit with a massive nostalgia wave, and with it came a Renaissance of the game. I had already expected 2019 to give me nostalgia for 2013, as the calendar is exactly the same and similar transitions are set to occur this year compared to 2013, but what I didn't know was that others were also going to get hit with a blast of nostalgia as well.</p>
			<p>On January 24, Nate Sawyers sent me a message on Discord, asking if I wanted to play survival with him, a request I had not received in nearly two years. The two of us played on a Telkit LAN world over the course of that night, and the next day at lunch, he told everyone else about it. They became interested in it, and they joined in.</p>
			<p>However, due to Weston's PC being unable to handle Telkit, a smaller modpack called Weston's Adventures was set up, and a new server was created. We divided into teams. Jackson and I were on one team, Jason and Weston on another, and Nate was a lone wolf. Later on, Wyatt joined Jackson and I, and Kirkland and Seth joined as lone wolves.</p>
			<p>As time went on, the Weston's Adventures server grew quiet and got to a point where no one did anything on it. In this lull period, Sean took the opportunity to change some behind-the-scenes things as performance optimizations, but mostly, college planning took up our time. Get to late April, and things begin to pick back up.</p>
			<p>After Prom, a big chunk of the friend group spent the early morning hours at Wyatt's house, the first time all of us had been together in a casual environment in a long time. Over the next week, we spent a lot of time together, especially on Friday, the day that the 2019 senior class walked around the elementary, middle, and junior high schools. That day, we went to a restaurant. At the same time, friends of ours named Joey and Kat (not the 2013 members) had set up a Minecraft Realm that we spent a lot of time on.</p>
			<p> The Third Golden Age continues to rock on even after high school, and until college fully changes things, we hope it keeps going. </p>
