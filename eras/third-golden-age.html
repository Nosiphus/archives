			<p>It is easy to state the obvious: 2018 was hands-down the single worst year of both my lifetime and in the timeline of Nosiphus. When that terrible year was finally brought to an end, it brought a new and highly-anticipated year. Little did I know just how well the expectations would pay off.</p>
			<p>In mid-January 2019, Minecraft, a game we all considered dying, was hit with a massive nostalgia wave, and with it came a Renaissance of the game. I had already expected 2019 to give me nostalgia for 2013, as the calendar was exactly the same and similar transitions occurred that year compared to 2013, but what I didn't know was that others were also going to get hit with a blast of nostalgia as well.</p>
			<p>On January 24, Nate Sawyers sent me a message on Discord, asking if I wanted to play survival with him, a request I had not received in nearly two years. The two of us played on a Telkit LAN world over the course of that night, and the next day at lunch, he told everyone else about it. They became interested in it, and they joined in.</p>
			<p>However, due to Weston's PC being unable to handle Telkit, a smaller modpack called Weston's Adventures was set up, and a new server was created. We divided into teams. Jackson and I were on one team, Jason and Weston on another, and Nate was a lone wolf. Later on, Wyatt joined Jackson and I, and Kirkland and Seth joined as lone wolves.</p>
		  <p>As time went on, the Weston's Adventures server grew quiet and got to a point where no one did anything on it. In this lull period, I took the opportunity to change some behind-the-scenes things as performance optimizations, but mostly, college planning took up our time. Get to late April, and things begin to pick back up.</p>
		  <p>After Prom, a big chunk of the friend group spent the early morning hours at Wyatt's house, the first time all of us had been together in a casual environment in a long time. Weston, Jake, and I sat up until 5 am making YouTube Poop references from 2009, something that continued throughout the year. Over the next week, we spent a lot of time together, especially on Friday, the day that the 2019 senior class walked around the elementary, middle, and junior high schools. That day, we went to a restaurant. At the same time, friends of ours named Joey and Kat (not the 2013 members) had set up a Minecraft Realm that we spent a lot of time on.</p>
			<p>The Realm was active for a couple weeks, and its player count shot up. When graduation ended, all of us and a few of the juniors went to our friend Jackson Benight's house, and a few of us, myself included, ended up staying there until about 4 am conversing about politics and life in general. The week between graduation and the Florida trip (I didn't go) seemed like it dragged on, yet it was welcome, as I wanted that week to go slowly.</p>
			<p>We spent the next day at Wyatt's, and that time, we were up until 5 am talking. I saw Wyatt and Maguire one extra time after that, and then they left for Florida.</p>
			<p>A week after everyone got back, I again returned to Jackson Benight's house, and a few of the guys were there. We recorded a video while we were there, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BscbZAthH80">the one true religion</a>, a video that emphasized the complete randomness of what our friends would do. On the night of June 27, Wyatt, Jake, Maguire and I were hanging out, and we had another night of hilarity. </p>
			<p> The Third Golden Age continues to rock on even after high school, and until college fully changes things, we hope it keeps going. </p>
