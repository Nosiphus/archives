		  <p>On September 16, 2013, I began to talk with Madison McGill, my then-crush. Since the incident of October 17, 2012, I had suspected she liked me, and I had grown to have a crush on her as well. I told her how I felt, and a relationship was established on that day. This began a new consensus in internal Nosiphus affairs, and brought an end to The First Golden Age of Nosiphus.</p>
		  <p>Our relationship sent the entire school into shock. After all, during the preceding year, bitter factionalism driven by the conflict between Roman and I had emerged, and it was no secret. The relationship drove up interest in me significantly. A girl in my social studies class, Sydney Cook, decided it was her duty to infuriate Madison as much as possible. She pretended to harbor emotion for me, and, as a naive twelve year old, I told Madison everything to keep myself away from trouble. The conflict continued well into 2014, and the two school dances of January and February cemented the problems. I witnessed Madison push Sydney from afar at the first dance. When I held Madison's hand at the second dance, she purposely ensured that Sydney saw it.</p>
		  <p>During this time period, Nosiphus also began to march down the path of relentless expansionism. Kolby's friend Esther joined Nosiphus, and in early 2014, Brianna Liberati joined. At home, Riley, Colton, and many others joined Nosiphus. The server had gotten to a point of no return.</p>
		  <p>However, as a seventh grader, one thing I never expressed properly was the fact that I was still a bit worried about talking to Madison personally. In hindsight, while I learned a lot from the relationship, I was still too naive at the time to have been in one. We broke up on April 29, 2014. The school noticed after about five days that the two of us were no longer together, and, eventually, Madison left the public school environment altogether.</p>
		  <p>Although the relationship ended on April 29, the rampant internationalism was not halted, it only got more powerful. The server had a foothold throughout the United States, and players from Mexico had also appeared on the server, requiring a Translator plugin to be installed.</p>
		  <p>During that summer, a vanilla Minecraft server launched that had players from across the globe, with multiple different nations. Among those nations were the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Mexico, the Phillipines, and France. We grew exponentially throughout the summer, and for the first time, Nosiphus had a foothold in a completely different part of the world.</p>
		  <p>Razer Comms was adopted as our primary communications platform to replace Skype.</p>
		  <p>At the end of July, however, the international coalition we had put together was proving to hold problems. Internal factions had emerged within the international community we held. Wyatt, who had been in favor of keeping the Nosiphus server private in the first place, began to push for the shutdown of the vanilla server. Eventually, it had become highly unmanageable, and was shut down in late July.</p>
		  <p>The Internationalist Times were drama-filled, like the era before it. What we were about to experience was a much needed change from that.</p>
