		  <p>When Maguire destroyed the server in The Great Server Destruction, I knew something had happened. Wyatt had rejoined, Nosiphus had an expanded member base, and we were making videos for fun again. I knew that when that video happened, it triggered The Second Golden Age of Nosiphus.</p>
		  <p>Many new members were brought in, including Jason Faucett, Jackson James, John Dent, and Zack Carter. Weston Simpson was invited back, and the suspension system was removed. Wyatt and I also brought in long-needed reforms to the company, including a reorganization of jobs. Wyatt became Chief Operating Officer, replacing Will Mills, who became a simple content creator. The new Nosiphus began to assign proper titles to members, and a new term, Nosiphites, emerged to refer to staff members. Wyatt kicked out Gummi and Maddie with my support, and we let Nate Foster go.</p>
		  <p>Sydney Cook rose to prominence not only as my main love interest, but also as an adviser to Nosiphus. I decided early on that if I was going to have an interest in her, I could at least use Nosiphus to deflect attention from my emotions. Between February and May, I was continually mired in a state of extreme sadness over her, and Nosiphus was about the only way to block the love depression. On May 9, I allowed her to view the 2013 Nosiphus notebook, and she made some notable improvements to it. Her presence caused the de-privatization of multiple Nosiphus assets, including the unfinished script for Hinkley's Manor. While my interest in her came and went in May and June, it finally evaporated on June 27.</p>
		  <p>After July 11, my playtime on the server seriously declined. I began to grow bored of Minecraft, and gaming in general. I thought I would return within a few days as I had before, but I didn't. On August 10, I began to watch old footage of myself from the early 2000s, and it became apparent that I would not see Minecraft in the same way again. I began to slowly reject the way I had run my life since 2009, desiring the way I had done things from 2003 on back. I noticed the key problems had been caused chiefly by the amount of time I spent outside being near-zero. When I recovered a toy I had when I was about five years old, I had to hold back tears from the emotional wave from seeing it.</p>
		  <p>Things changed a lot after August 10, and it was safe to say that the next few months were going to alter where Nosiphus was headed in the future.</p>
