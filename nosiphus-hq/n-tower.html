		  <p>During the Version Wars of 2015, a series of events where the server was going back and forth between 1.6.4 and 1.7.10, one thing did stay consistent on every map: we were using an updated version of the 2013 Blue HQ. At the time, the 2013 Nostalgia Wave hadn't really materialized yet, and as such there were no Nosiphus Archives.</p>
		  <p>As we wanted to add more and more to the building, it towered further and further up. It had the same number of floors, seventeen plus a basement and roof access, but it still wasn't enough. On August 11, Sean decided to do something that, for some reason, had never occurred to Wyatt or himself two years earlier: making the floor space square. He went to the back of the building, and moved the wall back the few blocks necessary to make the side walls as long as the front and back ones.</p>
		  <p>This process allowed for standardization of the windows. A few weeks later, the decision was made to modify the building vertically as well, which would allow for the windows to be square as well.</p>
