    <p>In March 2018, two factors were beginning to push Sean towards another radical redesign of the headquarters.</p>
    <p>The first factor was the upcoming move to Telkit 6, as Telkit Development Edition was really beginning to take shape in March, and due to version incompatibility, it meant that the server world would have to be replaced, meaning that the current design would not transfer.</p>
    <p>The second factor was that around this time, Sean was watching several Apple keynotes, and began to see the designs that Apple were coming up with in the 2000s, and then began to really look at both the design of Apple stores and the Googleplex. It was at this moment that Sean began to think about what Nosiphus was supposed to be, a software company, and decided to take part of the inspiration and give the HQ its most radical redesign ever.</p>
    <p>Planning for a multi-building campus began in March, and Sean came up with a list of several ideas of what the campus could have if the building were built in the real world sometime in the future, which was the plan for the new HQ. The decision was made in May to build the building in Minecraft as well. On June 7, Sean created a graphical layout of the new building, and then used it to build the campus outline in Minecraft. The screenshot is of the building during construction. It is not yet finished.</p>
    <p>After the resignations of Maguire Rodgers and Nathan Brandon on July 14, the studio building that would have been used for The Good Evening Show with Maguire Rodgers and The Nate Show with Nathan Brandon was converted into a six-story office area, and was designated to be the research and development department. We also redesignated the gym as a general recreation area, moved the pool indoors and converted the cafeteria into a cafe.</p>
    <p> In September, the world was again reset, and a slightly larger campus with a slightly different layout was used. In early October, the hotel and cafe were becoming too much of a problem, and were thus removed from the planning. In their spots, a new building was constructed, the Wyatt D. Mote Presentation Theater, a building meant specifically for keynotes and important announcements, although it could be used as a cinema as well.</p>
    <p>On November 25, the campus was given its official name, N2. The offices, originally located in the western wing of the front building, were moved to the third floor of the research and development building, and the building was retitled the Operations Building. We are now considering merging the eastern wing of the front building with the former gym and splitting the western wing off into a visitor center. In any case, Sean will do more work on the building in the week to come.</p>

      Red signifies outer walls, except for when the red line is between two yellow areas.<br />
      Yellow signifies open space, as do the red lines when between two yellow areas.<br>
      The gray represents the external walking paths. When the grey goes under a red and yellow area, the yellow and red area is on the second floor only.<br />
      Finally, the blue circle is a fountain.</p>
