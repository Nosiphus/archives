    <p>We have historically updated our home page with news every few days or so. Here, we will store all past updates we still have available.</p>
    <p>Recent as of Wednesday, July 25, 2018 - Update: Telkit is now compliant and public. The older packs are still private, we are working on this. </p>
    <p>Recent as of Wednesday, July 25, 2018 - We are making some changes to the way we operate here.</p>
	  	<p>
			<strong>1. Modpacks</strong> - Our modpacks have been made private due to OptiFine's modpack rules. We want to write a custom launcher which would allow us to open the monetized link OptiFine uses, but we've no clue where to start. We want it to look similar to the early 2012 Technic Pack launcher, and it would have all of our modpacks available.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>2. Members</strong> - Both Maguire Rodgers and Nathan Brandon have resigned. While this was expected, things are really starting to move back to the Sean and Wyatt duo on the Minecraft server, something that really hasn't happened in years. Wyatt always wanted the server to be private and was against the move to make it publically accessible, so we may consider reprivatizing the server and enforcing a whitelist once again.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>3. YouTube</strong> - We still have the remainder of Castaways to release. Sean is likely going to release the entirety of the six-hour session in one video.
		</p>
    <p>Recent as of Saturday, July 14, 2018 - The long-expected departure of Maguire Rodgers finally happened today. It's becoming more apparent that perhaps this organization has seen its glory days and finally should be sent off into the sunset as a fond memory of our childhood. Whilst the Nosiphus site will remain up and functional, as will the entirety of the Nosiphus Archives, we may have to throw in the towel before long.</p>
    <p> It's been a fun five years, and we won't forget a moment of it. I know I never will.</p>
    <p>- Sean Crain -</p>
    <p>"<em>Never forget where you came from. Don't forget, ever where you came from and where all of this started: In the mind of a kid with a dream.</em>" - Maguire Rodgers</p>
    <p> Recent as of Sunday, July 8, 2018 - I haven't made this knowledge public yet, but it is true that we have made an effort, and we have recovered the majority of the original 1360x768 footage of Nosiphus Mansion Video from the formatted hard drive. Somehow, most of the video managed to survive being overwritten. We cannot say the same about either part of Nosiphus Original Video, which we will try to create upscaled and sharpened versions of. That being said, the video footage is not all partially correct, as some frames are missing, but Sean is working on a mix and match using the recovered video, the released video, and the upscale of the released video. </p>
    <p>Recent as of Friday, July 6, 2018 - We have launched a new Discord server. You can connect to it by clicking Connect on the Discord widget further down this page. Alternatively, you can click <a href="http://discord.gg/AX6p6Vv">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Recent as of Tuesday, July 3, 2018 - The NosLabs Custom Blocks mod got a texture update on July 1. </p>
    <p>Recent as of Thursday, June 28, 2018 - So, we must address the situation over the course of the last few hours. Four members, Bri, Will, Zack, and Katie have resigned. Will, Zack and Katie's resignations were more or less on good terms, Bri left after a long and bitter fight with Sean. We have also brought in a new member who's been a good friend of ours for a long time, and his name is Bruce Wood. He succeeds Bri as Chief Creative Officer and we wish him the best of luck. </p>
    <p>Recent as of Sunday, June 24, 2018 - I would've never thought that we'd have come this far and still be doing it. Today, June 24, marks the fifth anniversary of the day when Wyatt and I loaded up the server for the very first time and began working on the blue HQ of Nosiphus Original Video. To think that half a decade later, we'd have taken the server from a tiny program running on my old laptop and turned it into a 120-mod behemoth with players from across the globe, some who didn't even speak English, would have been monumental and seemingly impossible to the two kids who just wanted to do what their heroes, the Yogscast, did on a daily basis. Wyatt, thank you for helping me build the server up into what it is today, and thank you for helping grow Nosiphus even when we had our differences. And to all our players and members, past and present, thank you for your support and your contributions. Nosiphus wouldn't be the same without you. Most of all, a massive thank you to Notch, whose game has touched all of our lives by allowing this to happen, and thank you for giving joy and a tool for creativity to the millions who play Minecraft. - Sean Crain - </p>
    <p>Recent as of Saturday, June 23, 2018 - Now that we have massively reduced the new Telkit server's lag spikes to near-zero, Sean has moved the Telkit server back to the dedicated server computer. The four smaller servers will once again be run on a provisionial basis as they are nowhere near as commonly used. As for Telkit Classic, we will attempt to create a new server and import the map, hopefully allowing the server to launch again. </p>
    <p>Recent as of Wednesday, June 20, 2018 - We have released an update to the PureBDcraft patch for Telkit that fixes the BuildCraft oil textures. When Sean ported the patch in January, he was unaware of the new heated oil system, therefore he did not map the oil textures to those blocks. </p>
    <p>Recent as of Friday, June 15, 2018 - Over the last few days, we've released several updates to the Telkit platform that have massively improved performance and tweaked the modpack to be a bit more enhanced. In 6.0.1, we also added Web Displays, a mod that allowed us to build cinemas within the game. </p>
    <p>Recent as of Sunday, June 10, 2018 - It's here! Telkit 6.0.0 has been released and is available on the Technic Launcher. it is highly recommended that you rename your existing telkit folder to telkit-classic if you want to continue using the 1.7.x line. </p>
    <p>Recent as of Wednesday, June 6, 2018 - We are in the process of converting the Nosiphus Archives to GitHub. You can see the progress by clicking "New Archives" in the Archives dropdown list. </p>
    <p>Recent as of Sunday, June 3, 2018 - We are aware of Mekanism not working in Telkit Development Edition. This is a bug caused by Project Red rendering issues, as soon as Project Red updates we expect this issue to be resolved.</p>
    <p>Recent as of Friday, June 1, 2018 - Hello summer, we've missed you.<br />
      <iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MsW8rXPcnM0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </p>
    <p>Recent as of Wednesday, May 30, 2018 - Lately, Sean has been doing some license compliance work on our PureBDcraft patch collections that he's simply not gotten around to. While this does make some things a bit different on the older packs, because they will not be mainstream packs for much longer, some things are no longer necessary that were needed before.</p>
    <p>Recent as of Monday, May 28, 2018 - Progress has been made on Telkit Development Edition's succession to Telkit. A world seed and generator have been selected, our Sphax PureBDcraft patches have been updated as textures come out, and mods are being updated regularly. The new server is being experimented with, and seems to be working fairly well.</p>
    <p>Recent as of Friday, May 25, 2018 - Welcome to the brand new GitHub-powered Nosiphus website! This is the largest overhaul the website has ever gone through, so not everything is done yet, but most things are ported.</p>
    <p>Recent as of Tuesday, May 22, 2018 - We have been working on this brand new GitHub-powered site for the past few days.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Sunday, May 20, 2018 - This summer is a very special summer. Throughout the entirety of the next three months, we have four major fifth anniversaries in the form of the fifth anniversary of the server launching on June 24 followed by the original three videos.<br />
      <br />
      But there is another, far bigger anniversary awaiting us at the end of the summer. August 24, 2018 will mark ten years since Sean came walking down the hallway at the right time to watch a commercial advertising the merger of Verizon and Alltel, which led to the creation of Blue Cove and later Nosiphus. It's the tenth anniversary of the founding of this organization.<br />
      <br />
      As part of the N10 summer, we will be obviously transitioning from Minecraft 1.7.10 to 1.12.2 as part of the updates to Telkit, but we will also be working on the newly revived and enriched designs we've come up with, notably Saturn and nDesk, and perhaps other ideas once they come rolling into the environment.<br />
      <br />
      We plan to release footage in our archives to the YouTube channel, as well as bring back legacy content in new productions. Ideas are being negotiated about the possible return of Nosiphus Nightly News with Sean Crain, and perhaps some of the other NTS-era programs. It may even be possible for Sean to dig out the old Mario plushes and record MBC Mushroom News with Mario again for some reason.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Saturday, May 19, 2018 - Two years ago today, Sean recorded all thirteen episodes of the Telkit with Sean series. Time flies.<br />
      <br />
      Here is our plan for the transition from Telkit 5.1.4 to Telkit 6.0.0<br />
      <br />
      1. Mod Stabilization<br />
      Whilst all mods are updated that will be in the new pack, we will not be transitioning until those mods get a few stability updates. Telkit Development Edition will continue to be updated in the meantime. The biggest thing right now is that until Davinci's Vessels updates, we can't add in LiteLoader and VoxelMap. The other big thing is that Thaumcraft is crash-prone on the server side.<br />
      <br />
      2. The New Server<br />
      As this is a transition across Minecraft versions, and as the new version will not have certain mods that are in the old version, this upgrade necessitates a new server world. We want all the mods that edit world generation in at the start, so once Thaumcraft and Buildcraft stabilize, we will begin testing a new world.<br />
      <br />
      3. Rebuilding<br />
      Once the new world is built, certain things will be transitioned from the old server, whilst other buildings will be rebuilt or replaced entirely. Nosiphus Studios is among these, the new multi-building corporate campus plan will be used for the rebuild.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Thursday, May 17, 2018 - Summer is here!</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Friday, May 11, 2018 - As of today, Nosiphus no longer supports Facebook and has therefore unpublished its page.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Monday, May 7, 2018 - Tomorrow is the first anniversary of How Not To Speak Spanish. To date, it is our only live action production.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Monday, April 30, 2018 - For the last couple of years, May 1 has typically been a day that the entire company goes through a bit of an overhaul. In 2016, Sean separated his personal accounts out and created Nosiphus accounts for former items, and in 2017 we spent the whole month of May working on an update to the "Big N" logo design in use since June 2014.<br>
      <br>
      As part of the new Nosiphus' emphasis on its original intentions to be a software company, and after expanding into the realm of hardware designs as well, we have updated our description with a new, simplistic tagline that for the first time can give an accurate picture of what Nosiphus is.<br>
      <br>
      Nosiphus focuses on designs that emphasize simplicity and ease of use coupled with customization and utility.<br>
      <br>
      While we cannot announce details or give out entire product descriptions, we can tell you that we are working on a new design called nDesk, which is unlike any computer desk you've ever seen before.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Monday, April 30, 2018 - It seems strange that it's almost May. Soon, we will be able to sit back and relax for a few months with little responsibility.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Sunday, April 22, 2018 - We have moved all of the NCAD assets to the Blue Cove site, and the pages are now available under the Blue Cove link on the navigation bar.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Thursday, April 19, 2018 - It has been decided that the Blue Cove name will be utilized for Nosiphus Computer Application Development. NCAD assets will be transitioned to the Blue Cove site over a matter of a few days.<br>
      <br>
      We have also uploaded the ISO file of Saturn 2013. Download it from the Blue Cove Saturn page.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Thursday, April 12, 2018 - 73 years ago today, the world lost one of its greatest citizens when he was most needed. And whilemost alive today never met or lived during his time, there is one thing we can say for certain: We are most certainly glad that Franklin D. Roosevelt was in the White House.<br>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b8/FDR_in_1933.jpg" alt="FDR" style="width:25%"></p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Wednesday, April 11, 2018 - Sean has redefined the eras of Nosiphus. We are now in a Third Golden Age.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Sunday, April 8, 2018 - Today, we welcome the king of memes to the world of adulthood. Happy eighteenth, Maguire.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Thursday, April 5, 2018 - Telkit is up again.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Thursday, April 5, 2018 - 10:43 PM Central Daylight Time - Telkit will be offline for a few hours to allow the server computer to update to the latest build of Windows 10.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Wednesday, April 4, 2018 - The chief departmentalization effort revolves around the Saturn Web Content Division, which will be responsible for handling the operating system and its components' Internet assets.<br>
      <br>
      Sean is in the process of designing Saturn's folder structure.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Monday, April 2, 2018 - Nosiphus will be reorganizing its units over this month.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Wednesday, March 28, 2018 - Today's the day we take things back to the way they should've been. And I don't mean we take the Minecraft server back to its roots. I mean we take the thing that led to us launching the server back to its roots.<br>
      <br>
      Nosiphus' original purpose post-December 2, 2012 was to be the company that coded and updated the Saturn operating system. The Minecraft server existed to be the sandbox for future ideas of what Nosiphus might become, with possible ideas for a corporate headquarters as well as the testing ground for ideas for Saturn.<br>
      <br>
      As time went on, the computer application development division of Nosiphus became less and less important as the server and YouTube increasingly took over the company. In late 2013, Saturn, instead of actually being a programmed operating system, was simply a customized distribution of openSUSE Linux. We want to be able to write our own kernel and codebase, as difficult as it will be.<br>
      <br>
      From today, we plan to work on Saturn as a full system environment once again. We have some designs down, and we will be working on this over the next few years. This does not mean we will be abandoning Minecraft. On the contrary, Telkit will continue with its planned transition path.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Tuesday, March 27, 2018 - Telkit Development Edition is currently at release 6.0.3. Regular mod updates are being released, and we continue to check for newly updated mods that are not yet added to the pack. We have also included Sonic Ether's Unbelievable Shaders, starting with later downloads of 6.0.2.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Tuesday, March 20, 2018 - We have a big, big plan laid out for the near future, and here it is.<br>
      <br>
      It has been decided that the 1.12.2 pack currently taking the form of e=mc² will become Telkit 6.0.0 whenever it is stable. In the meantime, a new server will be tinkered with and the new pack will continually be updated until it is ready for use. In the meantime, Telkit 5 will continue to receive updates as long as mods are updated. As far as we know, Galacticraft is the only mod in the 1.7 line that continues to receive updates.<br>
      <br>
      When Telkit 6 launches, the 1.7 branch of Telkit will become Telkit Classic. The 1.5 and 1.6 versions of Telkit were never used as packs, they are simply backports of the 1.7.10 line. The packs used during the 1.5 and 1.6 eras are known as the Nosiphus Required Mods and NosPack. Telkit Ancient's future is uncertain, but one thing is for sure: Telkit 6.0.0 will be rocking Minecraft 1.12.2.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Monday, March 19, 2018 - Spring Break is here! Here's a short list of some ideas we have for the week ahead.<br>
      <br>
      1. Server Refocusing and Restoration<br>
      Nosiphus has several web assets left over from the summer 2014 vanilla server that have laid dormant since that server went down. Sean wants to reconnect those assets and get them operational again. He is also considering a proper delegation of powers, giving certain sites proper administration by particular individuals.<br>
      <br>
      Sean is also in the process of restoring past servers to operation, among these being a server running the Nosiphus Required Mods pack with the original save. While doing this, he is also viewing past Telkit and Telkit-compatible worlds and porting parts of them into the main Telkit server.<br>
      <br>
      2. Nosiphus Archives PCs<br>
      The old computers that were once home to Sean's daily operations are still fully operational, and over the past few days, he has been restoring these computers to their original states. He is undoing his past self's Windows XP craze by reinstalling Windows 10 and re-enabling UEFI on the systems he modified. The plan is to not only get the old servers running on their original ports and IPs, Sean also wants to make each machine period-accurate for their respective eras.<br>
      <br>
      The Acer Aspire Z3-605 that is home to the Telkit server, while having UEFI re-enabled, will not be modified any further as it is the only computer besides Sean's main PC capable of running the Telkit server. There is, however, another machine available that, while never used by Sean himself, is not used by anyone else and will therefore become the 2014-15 machine.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Monday, March 5, 2018 - It's only five days into March, and yet this month is already beginning the process of redeeming the year from its first two months. On March 1, Will finally logged into the server after nearly three years of waiting, and we gained a new member who was not a returning member, and the weather is warming up. The number of current and active members has never been this high at any point in our history, evidenced by the both the Telkit and Discord servers' activity levels. Amplified by its fifth anniversary, the 2013 Nostalgia Wave is hitting me constantly and more directly than it ever has in the past. I hope these next few months are a time to be remembered.<br>
      <br>
      Sean Crain</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Thursday, March 1, 2018 - The day we've been waiting for throughout the past three years has finally come. Will Mills has joined the PC Minecraft club. We've also gained a new member in Katie Jackson.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Monday, February 26, 2018 - In the coming few days and weeks, Sean will be porting quite a few of our old buildings from legacy world saves to the current Telkit server.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Thursday, February 22, 2018 - Today, we welcome Bri back into Nosiphus. For the first time since the departure of Gummi and Maddie on February 4, 2017, Nosiphus has at least one girl in its staff ranks.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Sunday, February 18, 2018 - It has been one year since Sean and Wyatt filmed <em>Destruction Is Fun</em>. In addition to this, we have laid out plans to restore the tenth NosLabs to the current world by rebuilding most of the lab. </p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Friday, February 9, 2018 - We are preparing for a reboot of e=mc² that will be much smaller than its original projected size. While Telkit is pretty much finalized at what it is, we want to redesign our future packs to make them more accessible to players with computers that are not very powerful. The most recent change has reduced the e=mc² mod count from the Telkit figure of 139 down to 108. The mods were removed were the large, lag-inducing mods like Biomes O Plenty and The Dalek Mod.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Tuesday, February 6, 2018 - Five years ago today, Blue Cove officially rebranded into Nosiphus.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Wednesday, January 31, 2018 - Five years ago today, the name “Nosiphus” was born. Time flies.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Monday, January 29, 2018 - The newest version of e=mc² includes Galacticraft and BuildCraft. The pack was reassembled by directly updating Telkit instead of starting anew. As Thaumcraft is now in beta on Minecraft 1.10.2, we are hoping that it gets ported to 1.12.2 as quickly as possible.<br>
      <br>
      The remaining mods from Telkit that are not updated or replaced in 1.12.2 are:<br>
      Big Doors<br>
      CraftingTable IV<br>
      ExtrabiomesXL<br>
      Gilby's Voice Chat<br>
      Immibis Macroblocks<br>
      Immibis Microblocks<br>
      Jammy Furniture<br>
      OpenCCSensors<br>
      Project: Red<br>
      Railcraft<br>
      RedLogic<br>
      Thaumcraft<br>
      TubeStuff</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Thursday, January 25, 2018 - It's 1/25. Praise be.<br>
      <br>
      To Do List<br>
      1. Add Galacticraft and BuildCraft to e=mc². Update as bugs are ironed out.<br>
      2. Wait for Terrarium to update.<br>
      3.Continue testing with world generation until something satisfactory is available.<br>
      <br>
      Recent as of Tuesday, January 23, 2018 - There are multiple things we must update you on.<br>
      <br>
      First, Telkit is up and running again.<br>
      <br>
      Second, we are currently redesigning the way the site handles images.<br>
      <br>
      Third, Sean is in the process of backporting the enhancements made to the 1.12.2 version of the NosLabs Custom Blocks mod to the 1.7.10 version. A backport to the 1.6.4 version is unlikely, but may happen eventually.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Monday, January 22, 2018 - The Telkit server has returned to normal operation.<br>
      <br>
      We are currently in the process of redesigning the way the site handles images. The plan is to hotlink images directly from Google Drive so that whenever a change is made to the image in Drive, the site automatically updates.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Friday, January 12, 2018 - Due to reasons that Nosiphus will not be disclosing until the process has finished, all Minecraft servers, including Telkit, will be offline for the foreseeable future. This change will take effect sometime tomorrow after 8:30 AM Central Standard Time (GMT-06:00).<br>
      <br>
      During the downtime, it is possible that Sean will put up a summer 2013-style server running the original 1.5.2 pack. This transition will take some time, so I cannot give an ETA on when Telkit or any other big server will return.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Wednesday, January 10, 2018 - Presently, we are internally negotiating some of our projects, among them being <em>Hinkley's Manor</em>. We are also launching Labour, our political arm.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Friday, January 5, 2018 - In recent days, Sean has decided to reupload videos that were taken down for a multitude of reasons. Among these are the Out of Time and original Telkit series. Castaways is currently underway to being fully released, and it is possible that Telkit with Sean will make a return.<br>
      <br>
      Also, a very important update concerning an incumbent member, Weston Simpson. In 2013, Weston was involved with us for a short time period, though it was uncertain if he had been a full-fledged member. Recently, a document was found within the 2013 Archival Notebook that Sean had somehow missed confirming he was a full member from the period of March 4, 2013 to March 8, 2013. His time with us was brief, but that was before he was fully connected to the Nosiphus ecosystem.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Monday, January 1, 2018 - Happy New Year!</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Friday, December 15, 2017 - Over the course of the next few days, Sean will be releasing the remainder of the Castaways series.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Sunday, December 10, 2017 - e=mc² has received a proper modpack slug under the name e-mc2, and the old telkit-development-edition line has been restored as Telkit Development Edition.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Saturday, December 9, 2017 - Sean is currently preparing releases of certain archival assets never published in the past. We have also updated our copyright dates to 2018.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Wednesday, December 6, 2017 - We have moved the Nosiphus Unleashed server world claims to the Nosiphus Archives.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Sunday, December 3, 2017 - The NosLabs Custom Blocks mod has been updated to Minecraft 1.12.2.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Friday, December 1, 2017 - Five years ago tomorrow, the Nosiphus site will be celebrating its fifth birthday. Check out the original site here: <a href="http://windowsxprules1.archives.nosiphus.com/">windowsxprules1 HTML Experiment</a><br>
      <br>
      Check out e=mc², our 1.12.2 test pack.<br>
      <br>
      We are currently updating the NosLabs Custom Blocks mod to Minecraft 1.12.2. It will become available as soon as it can be.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Thursday, November 30, 2017 - We are currently working on a 1.12.2-based modpack to replace Nosiphus Unleashed in the long term. You can download and play with e=mc², the Technic pack that holds the in-progress update as soon as we get the page set up.</p>

    <p class="l">Recent as of Sunday, August 20, 2017 - Sean has returned, and he will be downsizing the company.</p>

    <p class="l">Recent as of Monday, July 31, 2017 - Well, it had a good run. As July comes to an end, we must reflect back on the past two months and see what we've done, and we did a lot. We created a new modpack, updated the archives to be more accurate than ever before, increased our size, added demographic listings, reintroduced support for legacy functions, redesigned the logos, and most importantly, we've joined more Nosiphus members to the server than have ever been able to join.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Monday, July 24, 2017 - In 2015, we utilized a service called plug.dj as a sort of radio station. When plug.dj shut down, we ended our usage of it. Now, the service is back, and we will be restoring our operations of it.</p>

    <p class="l">Recent as of Friday, June 30, 2017 - Three years ago today, Sean and Wyatt recorded <em>NosLabs: A Carpenter's Dream</em>, the first and so-far only mod review we've done. </p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Wednesday, June 28, 2017 - As the 2013 Nostalgia Wave continues, so does progress. We've decided to keep the server in its creative mode state, and the current world will continue to exist as normal. The current world save has been in use since October 9, 2016. The only world that was used for a longer period of time was the second mansion world that contained the tenth NosLabs, in use from April 2014 to May 2015. </p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Saturday, June 24, 2017 - Four years ago today, a new chapter opened in Nosiphus history when the very first Nosiphus Minecraft server loaded up at 11:30 PM. Today, we will be doing a similar thing. The Telkit server will be reset, and the world items from the Tekkit Classic server that is home to <i>Castaways</i> will be transferred over.<br>
      <br>
      Multiple running series was always the idea for the server was always the idea for the server, and so, there will be a merger. <i>Telkit with Sean</i> will merge with <i>Castaways</i>, and once the series is on the main server, then more people will be available to play. There will also be changes to the NosLabs Custom Blocks mod to introduce crafting recipes.<br>
      <br>
      The seed we use, however, will not change. That seed has been Sean's favorite since it randomly loaded back in February 2013.<br>
      <br>
      The 2013 Nostalgia Wave is in full effect. Sean will continue his pursuit of restoring the 1.6.4 world generator to 1.7.10.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Monday, June 19, 2017 - Today, I have integrated the Nosiphus Technic modpacks with the Discord server. I plan to tinker with the Telkit server to bring about tighter integration with the Discord server, and, if successful, will finally complete step one of The Openness Plan, which merges the entire Nosiphus Union onto one platform. - Sean Crain<br>
      <br>
      Update: Interoperability achieved! The Nosiphus Discord server and the Nosiphus Telkit server are now linked. The Openness Plan, step one, has been successful.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Monday, June 19, 2017 - Today, Sean has been reorganizing the Nosiphus gaming section. All of our Minecraft modpacks now have direct links. The downloads and mods have been merged with specific sections.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Sunday, June 11, 2017 - Sean has recovered several old Minecraft worlds of ours. These will be released to the public soon on the Nosiphus Archives website.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Thursday, June 8, 2017 - The era of the Big N is over. The new Nosiphus. A more familiar approach.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the new logo style being rolled out, two videos have been released in the past two days, Random Bits 2017 and Microsoft Sam Reads Stupid and Weird Signs 2. Check them out.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Tuesday, June 6, 2017 - Random Bits 2017 will be released ahead of schedule. It will be out today instead of June 14. This leaves more time to focus on remastering the three original videos.<br>
      <br>
      Due to 1.10.2 being updated at an incredibly slow speed, we will continuing on Minecraft 1.7.10 for the forseeable future. The Telkit 5.0.0 plan to be tied to Minecraft 1.10 is being scrapped.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Thursday, June 1, 2017 - Welcome to the best month of the year.<br>
      <br>
      There are some ongoing internal date corrections. It seems we have misplaced certain events in the calendar.<br>
      <br>
      Happy birthday, Notch! Without Markus Persson, <em>Minecraft</em> would not exist, and that is a very sad world. <em>Minecraft</em> is one of the most successful games of all time because of what it is, a creative sandbox game, and, without you, so many lives wouldn't have been able to use the game to express their creativity. Thank you, Notch.<br>
      <br>
      Random Bits 2017 is currently in the works, and a new date will be assigned for annual Random Bits release dates: June 14. Random Bits 2016 was released on June 13, 2016, but since June 14 is an important date in Nosiphus history, the release date for annual Random Bits will be pushed back one day.<br>
      <br>
      We have several important dates this month, most notably being June 24. June 24, 2017 is the fourth anniversary of the original Minecraft server launching, which happened around 11:30 PM on Monday, June 24, 2013.<br>
      <br>
      <em>Hinkley's Manor</em> is also in the process of receiving a top-to-bottom rewrite.

      <br>
      The Nosiphus website has undergone a redesign over the past few weeks. The site theme has become darker so that it is easier to read, the member pages have been redesigned, and The Openness Plan is currently in progress to make Nosiphus bigger than ever.<br>

    <p class="l">Recent as of Monday, April 17, 2017 - The scan has been finalized. Many files were found, but are for the most part too corrupted for usage. What is good, however, is the recovery of a world with a time-stamp of July 11, 2013. While it is corrupted and does not function properly, Sean believes this to be the ORIGINAL Nosiphus server world from 2013.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Sunday, April 16, 2017 - Currently, Sean is running a data recovery scan on his old laptops. Any undamaged files that are recovered will be edited and uploaded.</p>

From Sean's MBC Mushroom News and early Windows XP-based projects being restored, to legacy Minecraft topics, in addition to hours of unedited footage of a Tekkit Classic series, the channel's activity is beginning to pick up again.</p>

He is the first active member of Nosiphus to achieve this, as such, we may or may not do something over our three day weekend. * = note that documents were found later that actually said Wyatt's join date was January 8, not January 13.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Saturday, January 7, 2017 - The horror script known as <em>Hinkley's Manor</em> has progressed quite far, however, it is not completely finished yet. The set designs are in progress as well, but they are nowhere near finished.

    <p class="l">Recent as of Friday, December 2, 2016 - It has been four years since we got started after the time period between 2008 and 2012 that Nosiphus was just a figment of Sean's imagination. Now that we're in a second golden age of Nosiphus, you can expect some type of celebratory period over the weekend.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Sunday, November 27, 2016 - Welcome to the second Golden Age of Nosiphus. On November 3, 2016, the second Golden Age began with the events of The Great Server Destruction. Last night, a Garry's Mod session occurred that, if it had been caught on film, would've been very, very funny. Three episodes of The Dank Memes Report have been filmed, and will be uploaded during the month of December.

    <p class="l">Recent as of Saturday, November 5, 2016 - The server is going to begin its decoration for Christmas today. It may be a bit early, but, as you can probably guess, Sean and his musical sentimentalism over time periods overrides logic easily.</p>

    <p class="l">Recent as of Tuesday, October 25, 2016 - After fifteen years, Sean must do as he always done every October 25. It got us restarted in late 2012, and because of it we are where we are now.<br>

    <p class="l">Recent as of Wednesday, September 14, 2016 - Wyatt Mote has become more active in recent weeks, as such he is now considered a de facto member. The government system is now gone, and Nosiphus is restoring its roots.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Tuesday, August 30, 2016 - We are currently undergoing a logo redesign and a server reset. We are also restoring the old position names.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Wednesday, August 24, 2016 - Today is the eight year anniversary of the founding of Nosiphus. Some kind of special is planned for sometime in the next couple of weeks. We are also in negotiations with Wyatt Mote to arrange for him to rejoin the organization.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Sunday, August 14, 2016 - We bid adieu to Summer 2016. Telkit with Sean's first recording session, which was done on May 19, 2016, has finally finished its upload. As we still have a world backup from right after Telkit 13 took place, the later episodes that were corrupted by Bandicam will simply not be uploaded. We have also restored our old logo.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Friday, July 29, 2016 - It is with a heavy heart that we announce the discontinuation of Eskimo Jesus as our mascot.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Saturday, July 16, 2016 - Nosiphus no longer supports Razer Comms. We are moving our internal communications back to Skype.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Wednesday, July 13, 2016 - On the server, staff are usually referred to by their server government positions. Today, we merge the server government with the Nosiphus administration. From here on out, the Big Six are now known as the Nosiphus government.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Monday, July 11, 2016 - This is a special week for Nosiphus, as it contains the anniversaries of the first three Nosiphus videos, on July 10, 11, and 20 respectively. We intend to do something special commemorating this.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Tuesday, June 26, 2016 - With three new members, all girls, not only is Nosiphus now split evenly between the sexes for the first time, and new member Maddie has taken over the graphics production from Sean.</p>

    <p class="l">Recent as of Monday, December 22, 2014 - NosPack for Minecraft 1.6.4 has been updated to include a fix for the crash on Java 8, and we will be updating to Java 8 for NosPack. Windows XP 64-Bit Edition users will have to continue using Java 7.'</p>
    <p class="l">Posts between June 8, 2014 and December 22, 2014 have been lost.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Sunday, June 8, 2014 - Starting today, Nosiphus is changing its logos. The long-running Big Red Solid Color N has been slanted, turned white on the inside, and we have added blue waves behind it. The font is still Franklin Gothic Medium, and all of our policies are the same. Our font will not change, but we will be modifying our policies in the near future. </p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Monday, June 2, 2014 - It's almost summer time for the Nosiphus work force and we are going to get the server done best as possible for the first official sneak peek. The Nosiphus animated series are going to start being filmed along with Classic Doctor Who. So be ready. </p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Friday, May 16, 2014 - As you can see by our new navigation panel, we will be changing the site up quite a bit. Some things, like Red Co. and the Minecraft Construction Efforts are gone, and that's because Red Co. no longer exists and the Minecraft Construction Efforts are best kept quiet. </p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Sunday, May 11, 2014 - Happy Mother's Day! The Modded Server has regained the mansion world due to the sheer awesomeness of the Tenth NosLabs. Also, we have fixed the error of the web address that has plagued us for a long time. Before May 10, 2014, the address for this page would still say http://www.nosiphus.com/. Now it has the subpage name as well. </p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Wednesday, April 30, 2014 - Sean and Madison have broken up and she has left Nosiphus. We are returning to the old site because we want the old ways back. As for the Modded Server, which is the only remaining Nosiphus server, we have reset the world and are essentially returning to the old Minecraft 1.5.2 server, but we are remaining on Minecraft 1.6.4. Sean is still a bit down after the break up, and is therefore still adjusting to change. But times are changing, and eventually, once the summer arrives, we will all be happy again. Besides, our Summer 2013 memories will return with the old server world. But as for the relationship, to quote the Fourth Doctor, "It's the end. But the moment has been prepared for."</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Tuesday, March 4, 2014 - The modded server has a new world and the Tekkit server and the Voltz server have been remade.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Friday, February 28, 2014 - The company will shrink down again to exclude some Nosiphus members. A management policy has been enforced by Maguire that renders the May 2013 policy Wyatt put in void. Samuel has been cut due to treason and his attempts to shut down the company, and the 1.7 Minecraft server will probably be shut down once Esther and Kaitlyn get the mods. I'm cutting the influence of Sherry out of the company and shrinking Nosiphus down.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Friday, February 7, 2014 - The Modded Server has been updated once more, and a gym has been added to the lab. Later this month, new members will be added into the company.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Thursday, January 2, 2014 - It has been discovered that RAM wasn't the server's problem: It was the CPU. The AMD Vision E2 Processor simply isn't enough for the server to work. Although a RAM upgrade would be useful, a processor upgrade would be more desired. On the client copy of the server world, NosLabs has been built onto, and the old Galacticraft launch bay has been replaced. A bunker has been added to the lab, for any minor and completely accidental damage to NosLabs or the server world save.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Sunday, December 22, 2013 - With Christmas rapidly approaching, we are all in need of one thing: RAM. With the servers in the condition they are, they are constantly crashing for no apparent reason. It could be Java, but RAM is probably the true culprit. History has been updated, Olivia Jones and WalStar gained new logos, and everything is up to date.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Wednesday, December 4, 2013 - Saturn 2013 is here! Finally! We are celebrating the Nosiphus website's first anniversary! So we are restarting the modded server that we have recently abandoned. </p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Thursday, November 28, 2013 - Happy Thanksgiving! We are now finally getting the pages of members who haven't wrote on them finished up. </p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Sunday, November 24, 2013 - Dalton and Maguire* have left the company. That is another 2 MAJOR support pillars crumbled. Saturn is now crap until the foreseeable future. The website is now bringing back old services. So go navigate!<br>
      Maguire and Wyatt had a miscommunication. Maguire did not leave Nosiphus on November 24, 2013.</p>
    <p class="l">Recent as of Thursday, October 31, 2013 - Happy Halloween! Nosiphus has decided that Saturn 2013 is garbage and it will create a better version after more C++ knowledge is obtained. </p>
    <p class="l">Posts before October 31, 2013 are lost. </p>
