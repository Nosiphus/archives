		  <p>We have historically updated our home page with news every few days or so. Here, we will store all past updates we still have available.</p>
		  <p>Recent as of Wednesday, June 6, 2018 - We are in the process of converting the Nosiphus Archives to GitHub. You can see the progress by clicking "New Archives" in the Archives dropdown list. </p>
		  <p>Recent as of Sunday, June 3, 2018 - We are aware of Mekanism not working in Telkit Development Edition. This is a bug caused by Project Red rendering issues, as soon as Project Red updates we expect this issue to be resolved.</p>
		  <p>Recent as of Friday, June 1, 2018 - Hello summer, we've missed you.<br /><iframe width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MsW8rXPcnM0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
		  <p>Recent as of Wednesday, May 30, 2018 - Lately, Sean has been doing some license compliance work on our PureBDcraft patch collections that he's simply not gotten around to. While this does make some things a bit different on the older packs, because they will not be mainstream packs for much longer, some things are no longer necessary that were needed before.</p>
		  <p>Recent as of Monday, May 28, 2018 - Progress has been made on Telkit Development Edition's succession to Telkit. A world seed and generator have been selected, our Sphax PureBDcraft patches have been updated as textures come out, and mods are being updated regularly. The new server is being experimented with, and seems to be working fairly well.</p>
		  <p>Recent as of Friday, May 25, 2018 - Welcome to the brand new GitHub-powered Nosiphus website! This is the largest overhaul the website has ever gone through, so not everything is done yet, but most things are ported.</p>
		  <p>Recent as of Tuesday, May 22, 2018 - We have been working on this brand new GitHub-powered site for the past few days.</p>
		  <p class="l">Recent as of Sunday, May 20, 2018 - This summer is a very special summer. Throughout the entirety of the next three months, we have four major fifth anniversaries in the form of the fifth anniversary of the server launching on June 24 followed by the original three videos.<br /><br /></b>But there is another, far bigger anniversary awaiting us at the end of the summer. August 24, 2018 will mark ten years since Sean came walking down the hallway at the right time to watch a commercial advertising the merger of Verizon and Alltel, which led to the creation of Blue Cove and later Nosiphus. It's the tenth anniversary of the founding of this organization.<br /><br />As part of the N10 summer, we will be obviously transitioning from Minecraft 1.7.10 to 1.12.2 as part of the updates to Telkit, but we will also be working on the newly revived and enriched designs we've come up with, notably Saturn and nDesk, and perhaps other ideas once they come rolling into the environment.<br /><br />We plan to release footage in our archives to the YouTube channel, as well as bring back legacy content in new productions. Ideas are being negotiated about the possible return of Nosiphus Nightly News with Sean Crain, and perhaps some of the other NTS-era programs. It may even be possible for Sean to dig out the old Mario plushes and record MBC Mushroom News with Mario again for some reason.</p>
		  <p class="l">Recent as of Saturday, May 19, 2018 - Two years ago today, Sean recorded all thirteen episodes of the Telkit with Sean series. Time flies.<br /><br />Here is our plan for the transition from Telkit 5.1.4 to Telkit 6.0.0<br /><br />1. Mod Stabilization<br />Whilst all mods are updated that will be in the new pack, we will not be transitioning until those mods get a few stability updates. Telkit Development Edition will continue to be updated in the meantime. The biggest thing right now is that until Davinci's Vessels updates, we can't add in LiteLoader and VoxelMap. The other big thing is that Thaumcraft is crash-prone on the server side.<br /><br />2. The New Server<br />As this is a transition across Minecraft versions, and as the new version will not have certain mods that are in the old version, this upgrade necessitates a new server world. We want all the mods that edit world generation in at the start, so once Thaumcraft and Buildcraft stabilize, we will begin testing a new world.<br /><br />3. Rebuilding<br />Once the new world is built, certain things will be transitioned from the old server, whilst other buildings will be rebuilt or replaced entirely. Nosiphus Studios is among these, the new multi-building corporate campus plan will be used for the rebuild.</p>
